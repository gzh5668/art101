    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
			We need to do some experiment with DOM manipulation.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
			We spent a lot of time figuring out how to find the output and assign it to
      the variable outputEl. We thought the method we used was wrong,
      but it turned out that we just spell things wrong.
		</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      Everything works perfectly. <br>
      Here is the output!
    </p>
    <div id ='output'>
