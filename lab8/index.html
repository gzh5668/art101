  <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
			We have to experiment a bit to figure out how to pass a function
			into another function as an argument.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
			The process of completing the main tasks was very smooth, we only had
			issues understanding the bonus tasks, fortunately we were able to figure out a few ones.
		</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
			Everything works perfectly. <br>
			Go to the console to see the output!
