      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>
        We had problems with them while we were doing the bonus tasks, and back
        then, we didn't have enough time to debug and learn where things went wrong during coding.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Problems are the same as we met before. Through the lecture, now we have a different method to solve them.
        The debugger is very useful in coding. It is more effective than using console log.<br>
      </p>

      <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>
      We used the debugger to figure out why the first button didn’t work, and the debugger didn’t even react when I clicked it, so I realized there must be a typo somewhere in the code.<br>
