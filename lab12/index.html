    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
  		We need to create functions that depends on conditionals.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
      The main problems we got into are always bugs, we couldn't see the output
      and the console didn't show any errors, which took us some time to figure out what's wrong.
      It turned out that we misspelled a period.
  	</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      Everything works perfectly. <br>
